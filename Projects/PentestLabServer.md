## Project goals:
- Build a pentesting lab on a bare metal hypervisor
- Gain more experience segregating network segments with firewalls
- Set up network monitoring on segmented portion of network so as to reduce the size of logged traffic

## Completed work:
- Set up pfSense firewall
- Configure subnets to converse with each other via pfSense
- Installed <a href = "SuricataIDS">Suricata IDS</a>

## Next steps:
- Set up script for fan speeds

## Project updates

### 11/18/24:
I have added an Ubuntu server to the lab that is running Suricata. This will be set to promiscuous mode for traffic monitoring and IDS purposes.

### 11/03/24:
I have set up a pfSense firewall on my lab - I will be setting Snort up on this and running my attacking machines and target machines on separate subnets, requiring use of pfSense to cross between, thus permitting me to easily log all attacking traffic. Placing both subnets behind the firewall also improves my own network's security, as I will configure rules so as that incoming traffic from the internet cannot reach either the vulnerable machines which would prove easy targets, or my attacking machines, which would prove to be useful platforms for pivoting within my local network.

### 11/02/24:
I managed to secured a Dell R720 server with 192 GB of RAM. This seems ideal for running large numbers of virtual machines. I did have some difficulties in setting up, however - this particular server is extremely loud by default and required some tuning in order to be viable in my shared home. Using ipmitools, I have managed to manually set the fan speed lower and get the noise level reduced significantly. I have also configured the server to automatically shut down if temperatures reach critical levels.

Since part of setting the fan speed low enough to be a manageable volume involved turning off system control of the fans, I am going to want to set up a system for adjusting the fan speed on the fly if temperatures increase. Right now, I am looking at setting up a script on an SNMP server configured to tell the pentesting lab server to increase fan speed upon temperature traps, and decrease when those temperatures have reduced.
